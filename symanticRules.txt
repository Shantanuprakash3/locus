Some of the type checking rules are :-

1. The type of an identifier is the type while declaring the variable.
2. The type of tk_int is an integer.
3. The type of tk_point is an array of integers.
4. The type of tk_polygon is an array of points.
5. Some of the type rules and conversions are :
   a. integer_id = integer_id + integer_id
   b. integer_id = integer + integer_id
   c. integer = point _dist_ point
   d. point   = point _nn_ polygon


Some of the semantic rules are :
1. An identifier must be declared before its use.
2. The type returned by a function must be same as the type used which 	  declaring the function.
3. An if statement must have expression of boolean type.
4. A while statement must have expression of boolean type.
5. function overloading is not allowed.
6. The right hand side of an assignment statement must be of the same type as the type of the left hand side.
7. The functions have to be declared before the main function.
